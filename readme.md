# Run Buddy
## Description


This repository is a module project in The Ohio State University coding boot camp program for 2022.  The purpose of the project is to apply best practices in semantic 
html structure and css styling for a fictional company's homepage.  Then to modify the page as skills are taught to incorporate more functionality and flexibility.
During this project I made several mistakes, back tracked several times, but ultimately gained a higher 
comfort level with the git commit/git push process, html and css.

## Installation

This is a very basic page and no specific instructions should be required here.

## Usage

I am still learning and unsure of what specific usage requirements might be appropriate to show

## Credits

I'd like to recognize The Ohio Stat University, Trilogy Education Services and the instructor and TA's for getting us off to a great start!
